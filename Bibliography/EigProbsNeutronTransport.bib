	abstract = {A simple numerical scheme is presented for the evaluation of fundamental and higher discrete time-eigenvalues of neutron transport equation. It is based on the direct solution of a matrix equation obtained by discretisation of integro-differential form of the transport equation by using the Sn-method with Diamond Difference scheme. The scheme is applied to mono-energetic homogeneous slab cases with isotropic scattering and verified against published accurate semi-analytical results. Although less accurate than the semi-analytical method, the scheme is more versatile. It is shown to be applicable to spatially heterogeneous cases also.},

	abstract = {Two new methods of obtaining dominant prompt alpha-modes (sometimes referred to as time-eigenfunctions) of the multigroup neutron diffusion equation are discussed. In the first of these, we initially compute the dominant K-eigenfunctions and K-eigenvalues (denoted by λ1, λ2, λ3 … etc.; λ1 being equal to the Keff) for the given nuclear reactor model, by existing method based on sub-space iteration (SSI) which is an improved version of power iteration method. Subsequently, a uniformly distributed (positive or negative) 1/v absorber of sufficient concentration is added so as to make a particular eigenvalue λi equal to unity. This gives ith alpha-mode. This procedure is repeated to find all the required alpha-modes. In the second method, we solve the alpha-eigenvalue problem directly by SSI method. This is clearly possible for a sub-critical reactor for which the inverse of the dominant alpha-eigenvalues are also the largest in magnitude as required by the SSI method. Here, the procedure is made applicable even to a super-critical reactor by making the reactor model sub-critical by the addition of a 1/v absorber. Results of these calculations for a 3-D two group PHWR test-case are given. These results are validated against the results as obtained by a completely different approach based on Orthomin(1) algorithm published earlier. The direct method based on the sub-space iteration strategy is found to be a simple and reliable method for obtaining any number of alpha-modes. Also comments have been made on the relationship between fundamental α and k values.},

The aim of the scheme is to provide a computational tool for practical reactor applications with real-life size and complexity, e.g. metal cooled fast systems with strong spatial heterogeneity. The scheme is based on the 3D multigroup Sn equations that are spatially discretized with the discontinuous finite element method. Both implicitly restarted Arnoldi method (IRAM) and Sub-space Iteration (SSI) were applied to the equations, in order to compare their efficiency. The results show that first is superior in terms of computation time requirement, but the second is a viable option for test and development due to its stability and reduced memory requirements. Finally, calculation results are presented for the Venus experimental Accelerator Driven System (ADS) core.},

Energy 18 (4), 205–227] to obtain the fundamental K-eigenvalue (K-effective) of nuclear reactors. Recently, it has been shown that the algorithm can be used to obtain the further dominant K-modes also. Since α-eigenvalue problem is usually more difficult to solve than the K-eigenvalue problem, an attempt has been made here to use Orthomin(1) for its solution. Numerical results are given for realistic 3-D test case.},

Derivation of the eigenvalue problem is based on a least-squares functional combined with a spherical harmonics angular discretization and spatial finite elements. The method is applied to a mono-energetic homogeneous slab and compared to semi-analytical results. The results are found to be accurate if the angular discretization is sufficiently refined. The scheme is also applied to a model ADS geometry in both one and three energy groups. The IRAM is found to be very efficient but the solution of fixed source problems that are part of the algorithm need to be accelerated in the multigroup case to obtain an overall efficient method.},

In an earlier paper we had discussed a method for computing the α-modes of the diffusion equation. The discussion assumed that all neutrons are prompt. The present paper describes an extension of the method for finding the α-modes of diffusion equation with the inclusion of delayed neutrons. Such modes are particularly suitable for expanding the time dependent flux in a reactor for describing transients in a reactor. The method is illustrated by applying it to a three dimensional heavy water reactor model problem. The problem is solved in two and three neutron energy groups and with one and six delayed neutron groups. The results show that while the delayed α-modes are similar to λ-modes they are quite different from prompt modes. The difference gets progressively larger as we go to higher modes.},

Such particles (neutrons) can move only to the right or to the left on the segment at a constant speed, and suffer scattering, capture and fission. We have shown that the time-eigenvalue spectrum of this model is made of a finite, non-void set of real eigenvalues, plus infinitely many complex eigenvalues, distributed in pairs of complex conjugates. A simple asymptotic formula for the high-order complex eigenvalues has been obtained. As an application, we have considered the following initial value problem: find the outgoing density of neutrons, at one end of the rod, at any time after the injection of a neutron pulse at the same end. A complete series expansion of the outgoing density has been given. The successive time-derivatives of this expansion show certain characteristic discontinuities which are due to the motion, from one end of the rod to the other, of discontinuities (wave fronts) of the time-dependent neutron population. This suggests that the imaginary parts of the complex eigenvalues have just the task of representing the oscillatory motion of these wave fronts.},

As with effective multiplication eigenvalues, there are few benchmark-quality solutions for time–eigenvalue calculations in multi-region multiplying systems, especially for systems that have divergent temporal neutron populations. The purpose of this paper is to describe the reformulations required and to add benchmark-quality calculations for several test problems. Green’s functions are used to model a multi-region, one-group, isotropically scattering, multiplying system in Cartesian geometry to obtain boundary flux values for a time–eigenvalue search and subsequent eigenfunction calculation. As usual with multi-region Cartesian systems, the solution is facilitated using (1) Placzek’s lemma, which allows us to consider a multi-region system one region at a time as an infinite medium, and (2) the calculation of the Green’s function solution for a nonphysical infinite multiplying medium.},

If the discrete spectrum of the anisotropic operator consists of two points only, as is the case in practical applications, the spectrum has the same properties as in the isotropic case.

This criticality problem has been converted into a matrix eigenvalue problem using the Fourier transform technique. The time eigenvalues lambda , which are complex in general, have been determined for spherically symmetric as well as asymmetric modes. For the former case, the real decay constants and the real parts of complex decay constants decrease monotonically with increasing system size and form two distinct families of single-valued functions. For the spherically asymmetric modes, certain new features emerge. The real decay constants are found to be multi-valued functions of system size and they do not always decrease monotonically with increasing system size. As the system size increases from zero onwards, the decay constants alternate between complex and real values and the real and complex decay constant curves interlace.},

	abstract = {We discuss iterative methods for computing criticality in nuclear reactors. In general this requires the solution of a generalized eigenvalue problem for an unsymmetric integro-differential operator in six independent variables, modeling transport, scattering, and fission, where the dependent variable is the neutron angular flux. In engineering practice this problem is often solved iteratively, using some variant of the inverse power method. Because of the high dimension, matrix representations for the operators are often not available and the inner solves needed for the eigenvalue iteration are implemented by matrix-free inner iterations. This leads to technically complicated inexact iterative methods, for which there appears to be no published rigorous convergence theory. For the monoenergetic homogeneous model case with isotropic scattering and vacuum boundary conditions, we show that, before discretization, the general nonsymmetric eigenproblem for the angular flux is equivalent to a certain related eigenproblem for the scalar flux, involving a symmetric positive definite weakly singular integral operator (in space only). This correspondence to a symmetric problem (in a space of reduced dimension) permits us to give a convergence theory for inexact inverse iteration and related methods. In particular this theory provides rather precise criteria on how accurate the inner solves need to be in order for the whole iterative method to converge. We also give examples of discretizations which have a corresponding symmetric finite-dimensional reduced form. The theory is illustrated with numerical examples for several test problems of physical relevance, using GMRES as the inner solver.},

The integro-differential form of the transport equation is considered. The SSI method is known to be an efficient technique to find the dominant eigenvalues of a non-symmetric matrix. It has been earlier used for eigenvalue problems in neutron diffusion theory. However, it does not seem to be tried in the transport theory case. Here, the use of SSI has been tested in transport theory for some 1-D mono-energetic homogeneous and heterogeneous benchmark problems. The space variable is discretised by finite differencing while neutron directions are discretised by discrete ordinates (Sn-) method. The SSI method needs frequent multiplication of the relevant matrix operator with vectors. As known from earlier works in this area, this can be achieved in terms of external source calculations for which a 1-D programme was developed and used. With the availability of more versatile Sn-method codes, it may perhaps be possible to extend use of SSI to more realistic cases.},

In our analysis, we show how the finite-difference approximates at the mesh points can be naturally extended to yield approximates for all values of the spatial variable and obtain a priori estimates of the global discretization errors for these approximates. In addition we show that superconvergence occurs for the (original) finite-difference approximates to the exact discrete-ordinates angular flux at the mesh points and for approximates to several of its spatial moments defined on each mesh cell. We present computational results which compare the numerical behavior of some of the higher order methods with that of several of the methods discussed in the above cited works.},

	abstract = {Synopsis
The eigenvalue problem defining the exponential time decay of a thermal neutron distribution is investigated. It is found that the decay constant is bounded whenever the neutron transit time is unbounded. For the particular case of spherical geometry, isotropic scattering and a simple thermalization model, the fundamental mode decay constant reaches its upper bound for a finite sphere radius. This implies that there are no discrete eigenvalues of the thermal neutron transport operator for a sufficiently small sphere. This is in contrast to the result for mono-energetic neutrons obtained by Jörgens. The problem is first illustrated by reviewing the results for mono-energetic neutrons for a single fourier component in an infinite medium, for a slab and for a sphere. Only the last of these has a bounded neutron transit time, and this also becomes unbounded when the possibility of zero velocity neutrons in a thermal neutron velocity distribution is considered. It is indicated, but not proved, that the conclusions drawn from the special model studied apply to more realistic models of slow neutron interaction with matter. The relevance to pulsed neutron experiments in small moderating samples is discussed.},

Here, a numerical approach is presented where the well-known Sn-method is used to generate higher K-eigenvalues of neutron transport equation via the generation of a fission matrix. Although less accurate than the semi-analytical methods, the inclusion of spatial inhomogeneities, scattering anisotropies and even more energy groups would be straightforward in this method owing to the versatility of the Sn-codes. It is also shown that the K-eigenvalues are always real in the mono-energetic case even if scattering is anisotropic. The inadequacy of the Sn-method to reproduce the flux-source reciprocity relation in spherical geometry, noticed during the course of this work, is also briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {A new algorithm of Monte Carlo criticality calculations for implementing Wielandt's method, which is one of acceleration techniques for deterministic source iteration methods, is developed, and the algorithm can be successfully implemented into MCNP code. In this algorithm, part of fission neutrons emitted during random walk processes are tracked within the current cycle, and thus a fission source distribution used in the next cycle spread more widely. Applying this method intensifies a neutron interaction effect even in a loosely-coupled array where conventional Monte Carlo criticality calculation methods have difficulties, and a converged fission source distribution can be obtained with fewer cycles. Computing time spent for one cycle, however, increases because of tracking fission neutrons within the current cycle, which eventually results in an increase of total computing time up to convergence. In addition, statistical fluctuations of a fission source distribution in a cycle are worsened by applying Wielandt's method to Monte Carlo criticality calculations. However, since a fission source convergence is attained with fewer source iterations, a reliable determination of convergence can easily be made even in a system with a slow convergence. This acceleration method is expected to contribute to prevention of incorrect Monte Carlo criticality calculations.},

	abstract = {[The purpose of this paper is two-fold: to analyze the behavior of inverse iteration for computing a single eigenvector of a complex square matrix and to review Jim Wilkinson's contributions to the development of the method. In the process we derive several new results regarding the convergence of inverse iteration in exact arithmetic. In the case of normal matrices we show that residual norms decrease strictly monotonically. For eighty percent of the starting vectors a single iteration is enough. In the case of non-normal matrices, we show that the iterates converge asymptotically to an invariant subspace. However, the residual norms may not converge. The growth in residual norms from one iteration to the next can exceed the departure of the matrix from normality. We present an example where the residual growth is exponential in the departure of the matrix from normality. We also explain the often significant regress of the residuals after the first iteration: it occurs when the non-normal part of the matrix is large compared to the eigenvalues of smallest magnitude. In this case computing an eigenvector with inverse iteration is exponentially ill conditioned (in exact arithmetic). We conclude that the behavior of the residuals in inverse iteration is governed by the departure of the matrix from normality rather than by the conditioning of a Jordan basis or the defectiveness of eigenvalues.]},
