\chapter{Introduction}

The discovery of nuclear fission in 1939 by Otto Hahn precipitated a revolution in science and politics. The construction of the first experimental nuclear reactor and the detonation of the world's first nuclear weapon forced societies throughout the world to grapple with this newfound energy source, whose use could power societies for centuries or bring ruin to its cities within hours. As countries throughout the world built nuclear reactors for energy, the nuclear weapon states built up nuclear arsenals of unfathomable destructive power. With the ever looming thread of nuclear warfare and nuclear reactor accidents in the latter half of the twentieth century, nuclear energy became feared, despite its utility in agriculture, medicine, and electric power production.  Nuclear energy and nuclear technologies remain controversial to this day. Fear of radiation (perhaps irrational in certain circumstances), nuclear weapon proliferation (a valid concern given the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the past three decades), and the open question of what to do with nuclear waste (a question of both engineering and policy), have slowed the spread of peaceful nuclear technologies. However, as the demand for clean, sustainable energy increases throughout the world and global climate change threatens societies, nuclear energy is once again poised to deliver the answer to an energy hungry world. Soothing the fears of nuclear energy requires forward thinking, where science and engineering come together with policy to create a culture of safety, risk management, and certainty. 

To this end, advances in nuclear engineering technologies have given scientists and engineers the tools necessary to solve the problems of nuclear energy and design even safer, sustainable nuclear technologies. Whereas seventy years ago the design of nuclear systems required approximation due to the limited knowledge of neutron transport and the nature of computation, today, large computers allow designers to take advantage of computing power and memory to model increasingly complex designs and problems. No longer limited by memory, the complex nature of neutron interactions as modeled by material cross sections can be more fully captured. No longer limited by computation, high-fidelity models taking into account complex geometric designs and complex nuclear cross section data can be solved for large numbers of unknowns, giving insight into the time-behavior of materials, reaction rates, and energy production. Continued advances in the mathematical field of neutron transport have allowed for the design of efficient solution algorithms, taking complete advantage of computing power. It is here that this dissertation seeks to make a new contribution to the field. 

This dissertation presents a new method to solve the the alpha- and k-effective eigenproblems of neutron transport. These eigenproblems describe the criticality and fundamental neutron flux mode of nuclear systems. Using a Rayleigh quotient minimization principle that is applied to a demonstrably primitive discretizations of the neutron transport eigenvalue problems and the properties of primitive matrices, a new iterative method is derived. The derived eigenvalue updates are optimal in the least squares sense and positive eigenvector updates are guaranteed from the Froebenius-Perron Theorem for primitive matrices \cite{birkhoff_reactor_1958}. For alpha-eigenvalue problems, whereas traditional techniques have focused on supercritical problems and were limited in subcritical cases \cite{hill_efficient_1983}, this method allows for the solution of both subcritical and supercritical systems. For $k$-effective eigenvalue problems, traditionally the update for the eigenvalue has been taken to be some norm of the angular flux. In particular, the total fission rate over the domain is often used to update $k$. It has been observed that using the Rayleigh quotient can improve the efficiency of the power method \cite{warsa2004krylov}. We show this is due to the eigenvalue update being optimal in the least squares sense.
