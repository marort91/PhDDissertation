\chapter{Acceleration of the Alpha-Eigenvalue Rayleigh Quotient Fixed Point Method by Anderson Acceleration}
\label{sec:AndAcc}

Like all fixed point methods, the alpha-eigenvalue Rayleigh Quotient Fixed Point method exhibits only linear convergence. In most cases, this rate of convergence is acceptable when other methods are unable to converge the alpha-eigenvalue and eigenvector of interest. However, there exists a set of problems where the alpha-eigenvalue Rayleigh Quotient Fixed Point method converges unacceptably slow. These problems are characterized by large domains where neutrons experience a large amount of scattering before finally being absorbed in or leaking out of the domain.
